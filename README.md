# mollie-cli

### :warning: WIP

The Mollie CLI helps you build, test, and manage your Mollie integration right from the terminal. 

It is based on the [mollie-api-go](https://github.com/VictorAvelar/mollie-api-go) wrapper and attempts to ease the integration process with Mollie. 

##### This project is inspired by the doctl implementation.
